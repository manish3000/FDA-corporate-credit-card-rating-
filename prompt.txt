●Objective: Train and evaluate multimodal machine learning models for credit rating prediction using the extracted dataset.
●Tasks: The Task involves two main prediction tasks:
oBinary Classification – Classify companies as Investment Grade (BBB and above) or Below Investment Grade (BB and below).
oMulti-Class Classification – Predict one of six rating categories: AA+, A, BBB, BB, B, or CCC–.
